# MyReads Project

This React application stores books from an API into 3 different shelves that the user can place them in. The user
can also search for additional books from the API and add those onto his library.

## INSTALLATION

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* visit port 3000 on your browser


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
